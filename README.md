# PseudoString
WhenYourTeacherForbidsYouToUseTheStringLibrarySoYouAttemptToMakeYourOwnString
As the title suggests, we were not allowed to use the <string> library in our Data Structures and Algorithms homeworks unless we understood how it worked in great detail, so I decided it would be a better idea to write my own string rather than risking to miss out a detail related to how the "string" functions.
I started writing this from 22:00 the night before the homework deadline and finished it at about 7:00 on the morning after( praise Red Bull and Pepsi). I've only spotted one bug so far but it's already been dealt with.
